The program encrypts text using 3 encryption ciphers

The first cipher that is used is a simple substitution cipher using a randomized cipher alphabet

The next cipher applied is an Affine cipher, which uses the simple function f(x) = (ax + b) mod m.
In this method each character is mapped to some numeric value, encrypted using the function above and then the resulting numeric value is mapped back to a character.

The last cipher applied is a Vigenere cipher which is a Polyalphabetic cipher.
This cipher uses a key of characters and is essentially a series of Caesar ciphers where the shift amount is based on a character in the key word.

Usually the Vigenere and Affine cipher only translate letters to letters but with the ASCII dict created in the code letters can be translated to other characters
This project was just for me to learn about the basics of cryptography and some basic ciphers so I wouldn't use this to encrypt anything super critical, maybe use it for just a grocery list for now.
